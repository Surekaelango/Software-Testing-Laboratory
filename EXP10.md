### DATE: 05-11-24                                                                          
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212221040167
### AIM: To write a python program for Fibonacci Series and generate test cases using Pytest. 

### Algorithm:

1. Write the python program for Fibonacci Series. 
2. Make sure that function name should be “def test_*():” and the line to be tested 
should have assert keyword at the beginning. 
3. Write some test cases for to be tested and save it as “test_fib.py”. 
4. Open command prompt and change the directory to where pytest and program is 
saved and type “pytest test_fib.py” and run it. 
5. Stop the program.

### Program:

```
def fibR(n): 
    if n==1 or n==2: 
        return 1 
    return fibR(n-1)+fibR(n-2) 
def test_fib_1_equals_1(): 
    assert fibR(1) == 1 
def test_fib_2_equals_1(): 
    assert fibR(2) == 1 
def test_fib_6_equals_8(): 
    assert fibR(6) == 7 

```


### Output:

![exp10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da5ede9a-411e-4a74-8269-7b49b6d5ca20)


### Result:
Thus, the python program for Fibonacci Series is tested using pytest and executed and output is verified successfully.
